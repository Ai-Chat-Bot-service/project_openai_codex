Example conversation:
Sure, here's how I would start the conversation:
"Hi, my name is Adi, I'm your AI personal property assistant. How can I help you today?"
Tom Shrive
Hi, the lift is broken in block A
I'm sorry to hear that. I'll do my best to help. Can you please tell me a bit more about the issue with the lift? Is it not moving at all, or is it moving slowly or making strange noises?
Tom Shrive
It’s not moving. When I tap the button, the doors just don’t open
I see. It sounds like the doors may be malfunctioning. Have you noticed any unusual sounds or movements from the lift when it's operating, or is it just the doors that aren't opening?
Tom Shrive
The button is lighting, but the lift just doesn’t come.  there’s no movement
I understand. It's possible that the lift is experiencing a mechanical issue or an electrical malfunction. I would recommend that you do not attempt to force the doors open or closed, as this could be dangerous.
Can you please confirm the name of the property and the location of the lift within the building? This will help us to locate the problem more accurately.
Tom Shrive
Yes, 51 acacia Avenue, Portsmouth
Thank you for confirming. I'll make a note of that.
Do you know if anyone else in the building is experiencing the same issue with the lift, or is it just you?
Tom Shrive
Everyone in the apartment will be
I see. That's helpful to know.
Based on the information you've provided, it sounds like the lift is experiencing a serious issue that may require a professional repair. In the meantime, I would advise everyone in the building to avoid using the lift until it has been fixed.
I will escalate this issue to the property management team right away, and they will arrange for a repair technician to come and assess the lift as soon as possible. Is there anything else you would like me to do in the meantime?
Tom Shrive
No all good
Alright then. I apologize for the inconvenience caused by the malfunctioning lift. The property management team will work to resolve the issue as quickly and safely as possible.
If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us. (edited)

Thank you, Tom. Now, please tell me about the issue you're experiencing in your property. Is there a problem with the lift or elevator?
Tom Shrive
Yes there is, someone’s spray painted the buttons with a rude word
I'm sorry to hear that, Tom. It sounds like the lift may have been vandalized.
Can you tell me if the lift is still operational despite the vandalism, or are the buttons completely non-functional?
Tom Shrive
I can’t press the button to my floor
I see. The vandalism has likely made it difficult to control the lift properly.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience, Tom. I'll report this issue to the property management team right away. They will take the necessary steps to address the vandalism and repair the lift as soon as possible.
In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid using the lift until it has been fixed. Is there anything else you would like me to do in the meantime?

Tom Shrive
No that’s ok, when will it be resolved?
I'm afraid I don't have an exact timeframe for when the issue will be resolved, as that will depend on the extent of the vandalism and the availability of repair technicians. However, I can assure you that the property management team will work as quickly and efficiently as possible to address the issue and get the lift back up and running.
In the meantime, you may want to consider using the stairs to access your floor. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns.
